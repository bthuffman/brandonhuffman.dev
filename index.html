		<h1>Professional Development Document</h1>
		<p>Last Update: 1/16/18</p>
		<h2>Career Buddy: Hunter Callaway</h2>
		<h2>My Learning Style:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Tactile: <span id="tactile"></span>&#37;</li>
			<li>Visual: <span id="visual"> </span>&#37;</li>
			<li>Auditory: <span id="auditory"></span>&#37;</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Organized, trained and certified dozens of Lifeguards and coaches in Red Cross First Aid and Water Safety.</li>
			<li>Designed an advertising and public outreach campaign that quintupled the number of athletes on New Mexico's flagship Aquatic Center's swim team. </li>
			<li>Organized and processed 5 years of backdated corporate financial information into a tax filing and audit ready format. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Qualitative Accomplishments</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Detail Oriented: I thrive on organizing information and diving into what factors affect systems and to what extent those factors impact . The draw back to this is that I can dwell so heavily on the details that I spend too much time on a task when a less intensive approach would be more efficient.</li>
			<li>Analytical: In seeking out the science behind events and frameworks I tend toward logical approaches to problems and solutions. Sometimes this dry approach can come off as insensitive and so empathy has become increasingly important to the delivery of my analytical findings.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Repository of Learning</h2>
		<p>Week 0. In my first week I learned about the basic outline of the course,
			started my PWP, learned about php, database design, mysql, and how to complete
			various javascript challenges.</p>
